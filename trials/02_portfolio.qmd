Just playing around in getting familiar with Portfolio allocation. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

```


Here are the funds (getting data from yahoo finance as of now)

To download data 

```{r}

library(quantmod)

tickers <- c('SGLN.L', '0P0001MRG1.F')
stock_data <- new.env()
yo <- '0P0001MRG1.F'
df <- getSymbols(yo, src = 'yahoo')

```
